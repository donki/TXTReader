Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "MauiAsset".

These files will be deployed with your package and will be accessible using
Essentials:

async Task LoadMauiAsset()
{
    using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");
    using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);
    var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
}
